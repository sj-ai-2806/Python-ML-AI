# Taxi Trip Duration Prediction

This project aims to predict the duration of taxi trips based on various features using machine learning techniques. The project includes feature engineering, model building, and comparison of multiple regression techniques.

## Features:
1. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features to improve the modelâ€™s prediction accuracy, such as trip distance, pickup time details, and more.
2. **Random Forest Regressor**: Implemented a Random Forest Regressor and performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
3. **Model Comparison**: Compared the performance of the Random Forest Regressor with Linear Regression to evaluate their prediction accuracy and effectiveness.

## Models Used:
- **Random Forest Regressor**: A powerful ensemble method, fine-tuned for optimal hyperparameters using techniques such as grid search.
- **Linear Regression**: A simple baseline model used for comparison to understand how the random forest model outperforms it.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or the Python script to train the models and make predictions:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Review the model performance metrics, including accuracy, mean squared error, and more.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of Random Forest in predicting taxi trip duration compared to Linear Regression, thanks to feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
